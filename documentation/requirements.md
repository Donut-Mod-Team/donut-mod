# Requirements/Feature specification

This document gives a descriptive overview for the requirements used for the development of the Donut-Mod. The requirements capturing both functional and non-functional behavior will be documented using Epics (corresponding to the main use cases that can be seen in the [Use Case diagram](/documentation/diagrams/Use_Case_Diagram_v1.png)). Each Epic will be then broken down to more concrete user-stories that define a more specific behavior that is subset of the Epic. Furthermore, lower level technical requirements, such as CI/CD will be handled by breaking down the user stories to smaller tasks (this document shows only the Epics and user stories). Requirements traceability will be handled using Jira and jira-ids.

* [DMT-19](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-16) As a developer, I want to establish a CI/CD pipeline, so that I am confident that the changes I make do not harm the code base.
* [DMT-15](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-15) As a data analyst, I want to be able to see how the mod will look like, so that I can evaluate the state of the mod.
* [DMT-14](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-14) As a data analyst, I want to be able to change the fonts and font sizes on the Donut Chart, so that I can improve the readability.
* [DMT-13](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-13) As a data analyst, I want to be able to change the colours on the Donut Chart, so that I can utilize different colour schemes.
* [DMT-11](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-11) As a data analyst, I want to be able to de-select subsets of data on the Donut Chart, so that I can review the data as a whole.
* [DMT-10](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-10) As a data analyst, I want to be able to select multiple subsets of data on the Donut Chart, so that I can highlight multiple aspects of my data.
* [DMT-8](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-8) As a data analyst, I want to be able to select a single subset of data on the Donut Chart, so that I can highlight an aspect of my data.
* [DMT-6](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-6) As a data analyst, I want the mod to display data in a Donut Chart representation, so that I can visualize my data in the appropriate format.
* [DMT-5](https://donut-mod-team.atlassian.net/browse/DMT-5) As a data analyst, I want the mod to be able to connect to the Spotfire framework, so that I can visualize my data.
