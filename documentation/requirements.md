# Requirements/Feature specification

This document gives a descriptive overview for the requirements used for the development of the Donut-Mod. The requirements capturing both functional and non-functional behavior will be documented using Epics (corresponding to the main use cases that can be seen in the [Use Case diagram](/documentation/diagrams/Use_Case_Diagram_v1.png)). Each Epic will be then broken down to more concrete user-stories that define a more specific behavior that is subset of the Epic. Furthermore, lower level technical requirements, such as CI/CD will be handled by breaking down the user stories to smaller tasks (this document shows only the Epics and user stories). Requirements traceability will be handled using Jira and jira-ids.
