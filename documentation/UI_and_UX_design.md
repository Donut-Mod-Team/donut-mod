## Prototyping <a name="prototyping"></a>
The prototype mock-ups used as baseline for the system, created through an interative process.

![Prototype-V.1.0](https://github.com/Donut-Mod-Team/donut-mod/blob/add-ux-prototype-v1/documentation/ux-prototypes/Prototype%20V.1.0.%20Donut%20Chart.PNG)

The first prototype created was created with a MVP (Most Viable Product) in mind. Because of this, we wanted to limit all features to only contain features necessary for a MVP. The first prototype therefore only contains a simple Donut Chart, lacking both colours and percentages, and some filler text in the center.
